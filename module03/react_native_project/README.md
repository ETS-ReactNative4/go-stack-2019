# Creating project

There are many ways to install a React Native project, however we will use **react-native-community/cli**:

`$ yarn add project_name` or `$ npx react-native init project_name` (if you do not want to install react-native-cli globally).

### Initializing app

After created the project, with your emulator or device connected by USB, you can run `react-native run-android`.
